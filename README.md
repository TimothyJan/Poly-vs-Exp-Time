# Poly-vs-Exp-Time
Polynomial vs Exponential Time

This project will test the following hypotheses:

1. Exhaustive search algorithms are feasible to implement, and produce correct outputs.
2. Recursion is not always slow, because recursion-based algorithms can be faster than loop-based algorithms.
3. Algorithms with exponential or factorial running times are extremely slow, probably too slow to be of practical use.
